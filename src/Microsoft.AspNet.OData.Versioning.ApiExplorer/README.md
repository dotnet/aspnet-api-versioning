ASP.NET API versioning gives you a powerful, but easy-to-use method for adding API versioning semantics to your new
and existing REST services built with ASP.NET Web API and OData v4.0. The API versioning extensions define simple
metadata attributes and conventions that you use to describe which API versions are implemented by your services.

This package contains the API version-aware extensions for API Explorer in ASP.NET Web API with OData v4.0, which are
useful in a number of scenarios such as test automation or OpenAPI document generation.
